# Driv Performance Theme

### How to run

This theme uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for the `scss` files and some other neat little tricks.

1. Go into the theme `cd driv-starter`
2. Install packages with `sudo npom install`
3. Finally, run `grunt`

### Goals:
* To be as non-intrusive as possible
* To put performance first
